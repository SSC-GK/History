Content Contribution Guidelines for questions.json (v2.0)

1. Introduction
This document provides the official guidelines for adding new questions to the questions.json data file for the Quiz App. To ensure data consistency, application stability, and a high-quality user experience, it is mandatory to follow this structure precisely.

The goal is to create a rich, well-organized, and easily filterable question bank. Adherence to these guidelines is critical for the filtering and data-parsing logic of the application to function correctly.

2. General JSON Structure
The questions.json file is an array of question objects. Each object represents a single question and must follow the structure below.

High-Level Structure:

{
  "id": "String",
  "sourceInfo": { ... },
  "classification": { ... },
  "tags": [ ... ],
  "properties": { ... },
  "question": "String",
  "question_hi": "String",
  "options": [ ... ],
  "options_hi": [ ... ],
  "correct": "String",
  "explanation": { ... }
}


3. Detailed Field Explanations
id (Required)
Type: String

Description: A unique coded identifier for the question. It must follow the format `[Prefix][Number]`. The prefix corresponds to the question's subject, and the number must be sequential *within that subject*.

Procedure:
1. Determine the subject of your question (e.g., "Polity").
2. Find the correct three-letter prefix from the table in Section 4 (e.g., "POL").
3. Find the last question of the *same subject* in the `questions.json` file and find its number.
4. Increment that number by one.
5. Combine the prefix and the new number to form the ID.

Example: If the last Polity question has an ID of "POL71", your new Polity question must have an ID of "POL72".
