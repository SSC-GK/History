The buffalo was crucial for this expansion, especially in wet areas.",

      "analysis_incorrect": "The question and options are slightly imprecise. The trade that was directly affected was the one controlled by the Sassanian Persians, who acted as middlemen between India/China and the Byzantine Empire. When the Byzantines learned to produce silk themselves, it broke the Persian monopoly. This would have had a knock-on effect on the **Indo-Persian trade (B)** in silk, as their primary European market was disrupted. The term **Indo-Byzantine trade (D)** is also relevant as the direct demand for Indian silk in Byzantium would have decreased. Historically, the biggest loser was the Persian empire's role in the trade.",
      "analysis_correct": "‚úÖ Why Indo-Byzantine trade was affected\n\n- Before the 6th century CE, the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was a major consumer of silk, which it imported at great expense from the East (China and India), largely through Persian intermediaries. According to legend, Byzantine monks smuggled silkworm eggs out of China, allowing the empire to start its own silk industry. This reduced its dependence on imports, thereby negatively affecting the long-distance silk trade from India and China.",
      "conclusion": "üìù Concluding Note\n\n- This event is a classic example of how technological transfer (in this case, sericulture) can drastically alter global trade patterns.",
      "fact": "üí° Interesting Fact\n\n- The Sassanian Persians and the Byzantines were major rivals, and the control of the lucrative silk trade was a significant point of conflict between the two empires."

After the conquest of the region by the forces of the Delhi Sultanate (during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, but continuing under his son Muhammad bin Tughlaq), they were taken as prisoners to Delhi.

However, with the decline of Buddhism in mainland India from the late Gupta period onwards and the destruction of monastic centers like Nalanda by Turkic invaders, the use of Pali for new literary creation in India sharply declined.

Siraj-ud-Daula was the last independent Nawab, defeated by the British in the Battle of Plassey (1757). After his defeat, the British installed the treacherous Mir Jafar as a puppet Nawab.

The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first Indian ruler to accept a well-framed subsidiary alliance in 1798.

It exposed a section of Indians to Western ideas of liberty, equality, democracy, and nationalism. This newly educated class studied the works of thinkers like Rousseau, Mill, and Mazzini and began to question the legitimacy of foreign rule, eventually becoming the pioneers of the Indian nationalist movement.",

After the revolt, the British saw the traditional princes and zamindars as a potential bulwark ('breakwaters in the storm') against future mass uprisings.

The process of 'de-industrialization' of traditional crafts combined with the very slow growth of modern industries meant that the manufacturing sector remained a very small part of the overall Indian economy.",

It created a class of intermediary landlords (zamindars) between the state and the actual cultivator. The zamindars were only required to pay a fixed revenue to the state, but they were free to extract as much rent as possible from the tenant farmers, leading to rack-renting, eviction, and immense rural distress.",

Land that was previously used to grow food crops for local consumption was diverted to grow cash crops (like cotton, indigo) for export. Furthermore, even food grains were exported to Britain and for the use of the Indian army abroad, even during times of scarcity in India. This reduced the local availability of food and greatly increased the frequency and severity of famines.",
      "analysis_incorrect": "‚ùå Why other options are incorrect\n\n- The other options are the opposite of what happened. Food availability decreased, and prices often rose during scarcities.",
      "conclusion": "üìù Concluding Note\n\n- The great famines of the late 19th century were not just natural disasters but were man-made calamities, exacerbated by colonial policies that prioritized profit and export over the lives of the Indian people.",
